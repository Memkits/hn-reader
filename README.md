HN Reader
----

> Simple UI built on top on Hacker News Apis

Previews http://repo.memkits.org/hn-reader/ .

Also maybe `extension/` can be installed locally for one click redirect of HN pages.

### Config Voice

To use API from `localhost:3001`, configure it with search query(or localStorage):

```
http://localhost:3000/?audio-target=azure&azure-key=<key>
```

### Side notes

I was trying to add a proxy server batching the data, but poor network between Firebase and Shanghai. Currently solution is slow, requesting data one by one.
